          <strong>Parental Involvement:</strong> If you are under 13, your account must be created
          and managed by a parent or legal guardian. If we inadvertently collect data from a child
          under 13 without proper consent, we will promptly delete the information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limited Data Collection:</strong> For users under parental supervision (e.g., in
          educational settings), we limit the collection of Personal Information to what is
          necessary for educational purposes.
        </li>
      </ul>
